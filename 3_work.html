          <h2> Ai Poem (2024)"</h2>
   
    <p>This work was made with Ai and Photoshop.<br>First i used an AI to generate the image that i wanted, for example King Arthur holding excallibur.
        I wanted to make something not usual so i searched for King Arthur if she was a women,
        Secondly i chose the best one out of 3 generated images.
        Then i went to Photoshop and edited the image.
        I added shattered glass to show that somethings breaking in front of her.
        After editing the whole image this was the result. </p>

        <h3>Ai generated poem</h3>
        <p>In days of yore, in Camelot's prime,  <br>
        A legendary king did reign supreme, <br>
        With Excalibur, his trusty sword, <br>
        He fought for right, and vanquished wrong, <br>
        His name was Arthur, and his tale was told. <br>
        
        His reign was one of peace and gold, <br>
        The land was prosperous, and all was well, <br>
        But as the years passed, and time did unfold, <br>
        A dark and treacherous plot did unravel. <br>
        
        A sorceress named Morgause, with wicked guile, <br>
        Did seek to steal the sword, and cause a while, <br>
        Of chaos and destruction, to bring to the land, <br>
        And with it, the downfall of King Arthur's hand. <br>
        
        But loyal knights, with courage true, <br>
        Did stand by their king, and saw it through, <br>
        Sir Gawain, Sir Percival, and Sir Lancelot too, <br>
        Did fight with valor, and their hearts did renew. <br>
        
        The battle raged, and the sword did shine, <br>
        As Arthur and his knights did fight divine, <br>
        Their courage and honor, did victory bring, <br>
        And Morgause's plan, did fail and sing. <br>
        
        The sword, Excalibur, did remain, <br>
        A symbol of power, and a tale so plain, <br>
        Of a legendary king, and his noble reign, <br>
        And the bravery of his knights, who did sustain.</p>
