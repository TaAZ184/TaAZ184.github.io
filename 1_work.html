          <h2> Self-portrait in times of "digital conversation" (2023)</h2>
   
    <p>This work was made with Photoshop.<br>Starting with the background, 
        I chose to make clouds with rays and some particles, representing the sky and the 
        night, with the rays showing how conflicting I can be in some situations, I also chose 
        a dragon in the center of the screen to symbolize me because dragons are the my favorite 
        mythological animal, dragons also represent me in society, these animals are not social, 
        they live isolated from the world in their habitats without any interest in the rest of 
        the world, I identify with them because my way of making designs or about the world of 
        design is very disconnected from other people. </p>
