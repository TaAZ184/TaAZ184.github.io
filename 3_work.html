          <h2> Self-portrait in times of "digital conversation" (2023)</h2>
   
    <p>This work was made with Photoshop.<br>First i used an AI to generate the image that i wanted, for example King Arthur holding excallibur.
        I wanted to make something not usual so i searched for King Arthur if she was a women,
        Secondly i chose the best one out of 3 generated images.
        Then i went to Photoshop and edited the image.
        I added shattered glass to show that somethings breaking in front of her.
        After editing the whole image this was the result. </p>
